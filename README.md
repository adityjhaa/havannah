# Havannah Playing Agent

This project implements a **game-playing AI agent** for the board game *Havannah*.

## ðŸŽ¯ **About Havannah**  
Havannah is a two-player abstract strategy game invented by Christian Freeling. Players take turns placing their stones on hexagonal cells of a board, aiming to achieve one of the following winning conditions:  
1. **Ring**: Form a loop of stones enclosing one or more cells.  
2. **Bridge**: Connect any two corners of the board.  
3. **Fork**: Connect any three edges of the board.

## ðŸš€ **Features**  
- **Smart Decision Making**: Implements search algorithms MCTS with RAVE and UCB to optimize move selection.  
- **Heuristic Evaluation**: A custom evaluation function assesses board positions to enhance decision quality.  
- **Scalability**: Supports various board sizes, from beginner-friendly small boards to full-size competitive ones.  
- **Interactive Play**: Play against the AI in a dynamic interface or simulate AI vs. AI matches to observe its strategic prowess.
